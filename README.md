Hybrid AI Crypto Alert System v4 (Daily Retrain)
================================================

Included files:
- config.json
- train_ai_model.py
- crypto_ai_alert_v4.py
- .github/workflows/ai_train.yml
- README.md (this file)
- models/ (empty placeholder; models generated by training)

What's new in v4
----------------
- Hybrid ensemble: LogisticRegression + RandomForest (averaged probabilities)
- Expanded feature set: EMA ratio, MACD, ATR ratio, wick ratios, vol change, rsi_diff, etc.
- Daily retraining (00:00 UTC) via GitHub Actions
- Dynamic symbols from config.json

Quick start
-----------
1. Create a private GitHub repo and push these files.
2. Add repository secrets (Settings → Secrets → Actions):
   - TELEGRAM_TOKEN
   - TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID
   - (optional) EMAIL_USERNAME, EMAIL_PASSWORD for fallback
3. Commit and push. The workflow `.github/workflows/ai_train.yml` will run daily at 00:00 UTC and retrain models.
4. To run alerts every 30 minutes, add another workflow to run `python crypto_ai_alert_v4.py` on a schedule or run the script on a server.

Notes
-----
- The trainer saves models as `models/crypto_ai_model_v4_hybrid_<SYMBOL>.pkl`.
- The trainer uses RandomForest (n_estimators=200) and LogisticRegression; ensemble is simple average.
- You can change feature list, thresholds and symbols in `config.json`.
- For reproducible training, consider pinning versions in requirements.txt.
- If pushing models to repo, consider Git LFS for large binary files.

Security note
-------------
- Never hardcode tokens in public repos. Use GitHub Secrets or environment variables.

If you want, I can now:
- Create the GitHub Action workflow to run the alert script every 30 minutes and save CSV artifacts.
- Add CoinGecko fallback for price retrieval.
- Add model-monitoring outputs (daily validation accuracy log uploaded as workflow artifacts).

New in v5
----------
- Added `.github/workflows/ai_alert.yml` — runs every 30 minutes to execute `crypto_ai_alert_v4.py`.
- Stores output logs in GitHub Actions artifacts (`artifacts/crypto_alert_logs`).
- Uses secrets for TELEGRAM_TOKEN and TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID.

New in v6
----------
- Telegram alerts are now sent **only** for Buy/Sell signals.
- Hold signals are logged locally but not sent as alerts.
- Email fallback still works if Telegram fails.
